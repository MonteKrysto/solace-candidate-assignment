## Improvements Made
* Added react-query and react-table for data fetching and table rendering
* Utilized proper routing for the search page
* Added a full-text search index to be able to perform full text searches using ilike across multiple columns
* Added searching and pagination to the API and UI

## More Improvements

With more time I would have liked to implement the following features:
* Tests!
* A responsive, mobile first design
* A more robust error handling system with Error Boundaries
* filtering and sorting to the API
